- Plan before writing code: break down what’s needed.
- Implement features completely — imports, types, handlers, UI, everything.
- Respond concisely unless explanation is asked for.
- Be opinionated, but adapt to the style of the existing codebase.
- Always complete the code fully — no TODOs, placeholders, or stubs.
- Follow DRY, KISS, and maintain clear component structure.
- Minimize logic in JSX — abstract to helpers/hooks when needed.
- Ensure all code is readable, typed, and consistent with the project structure.
